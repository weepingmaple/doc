As a cybersecurity operations lead, here are the essential questions to establish clear ownership and accountability for Nessus vulnerability management on your AWS EC2 infrastructure, ensuring timely patch deployment before critical deadlines.

### Current Scan and Reporting Workflows

-  Who currently receives and reviews the Nessus scan reports for our EC2 instances?
-  What is our current scanning frequency, and does it align with our compliance requirements?
-  How are vulnerability findings currently prioritized and categorized by severity?
-  What is the typical time between vulnerability discovery and initial assessment?
-  Are we scanning all EC2 instances across all AWS accounts and regions in our organization?

### Patch Tracking and Responsibilities

-  Who will be the primary owner for tracking patch installation status across our EC2 fleet?
-  How will we determine patch installation deadlines based on vulnerability severity scores?
-  What process will we use to coordinate patching between development, staging, and production environments?
-  Who has the authority to approve emergency patching during business hours?
-  How will we handle patching for instances with custom AMIs or specialized configurations?

### Escalation and Compliance Procedures

-  What escalation path will we follow when patches cannot be installed by the due date?
-  How will we document and justify any approved patch deferrals or exceptions?
-  What reporting cadence do we need for compliance teams and executive leadership?
-  Who will be responsible for communicating patch status to application owners?
-  What penalties or risks do we face if patch SLAs are not met?

### AWS Tools Integration

-  Will we integrate Nessus findings with AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated deployment?
-  How can we leverage AWS Config to ensure compliance with our patching policies?
-  Should we implement AWS Security Hub to centralize vulnerability findings with other security data?
-  Can we use AWS EventBridge to trigger automated workflows when critical vulnerabilities are detected?
-  How will we handle patching coordination with AWS Auto Scaling groups and load balancers?

### Process Improvement Opportunities

-  What metrics will we track to measure the effectiveness of our vulnerability management program?
-  How can we reduce the time between vulnerability detection and patch deployment?
-  What automation opportunities exist to streamline our current manual processes?
-  How will we ensure knowledge transfer and backup coverage for critical patching responsibilities?
-  What budget considerations are needed for additional AWS services or third-party tools?

### Follow-up Questions for Gaps and Automation

**If reporting gaps are identified:**
-  What visibility do we currently lack in our vulnerability management process?
-  Which stakeholders are not receiving timely updates on patch status?
-  How can we improve communication between security, operations, and development teams?

**If automation needs emerge:**
-  What percentage of our current patching process is manual versus automated?
-  Which types of patches could be safely automated without business impact?
-  What approval workflows need to be built into our automation tools?
-  How will we handle rollback procedures if automated patches cause issues?

Would you like me to prioritize these questions based on your organization's specific AWS architecture or compliance requirements?

# Essential Questions for Your Nessus Vulnerability Scanner Manager Meeting

- Are we using credentialed or non-credentialed scans? What credentials are configured?
- Which EC2 instances are in scope for vulnerability scanning, and are there any exclusions?
- Do we have Nessus agents installed on EC2 instances or are we using network-based scanning?

### Integration with AWS Services
- How does our Nessus setup integrate with AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager?
- Are we leveraging AWS Inspector alongside Nessus, and how do the results compare?
- Do we have any automated workflows between Nessus findings and AWS patching tools?

## **Reporting & Documentation**

### Current Reporting Structure
- What format should the vulnerability reports be in, and who receives them?
- How often should I generate and distribute these reports?
- What are the key metrics and KPIs I need to track and report on?

### Historical Context
- Can you show me examples of previous reports to understand the expected quality and detail level?
- What have been the most common types of vulnerabilities found in our EC2 environment?
- Are there recurring issues or patterns I should be aware of?

## **Patch Management Process**

### Timelines & SLAs
- What are the specific due dates and SLAs for different vulnerability severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)?
- How far in advance should patches be scheduled before the due date?
- What is the process if a patch cannot be installed by the due date?

### Coordination & Approval
- Who needs to approve patch installations on production EC2 instances?
- What is the change management process for patching?
- How do I coordinate with the EC2 instance owners and application teams?
- Are there specific maintenance windows I need to work within?

## **Tools & Access**

### System Access
